         Andrew Slayton is an adventurist and an up and coming software
         engineer. He has a love for exploration that spans back to his
         childhood. He discovered his love for tinkering when he took apart his
         XBOX 360 in 6th grade(and broke it). Once he discovered his passion for
         tinkering with electronics he was set on computer science. Ever since
         then he has been on a journey to simply learn more to tinker more.
